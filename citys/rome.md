With its vibrant piazzas, rich culinary scene, and lively atmosphere, Rome offers a perfect mix of history, culture, and modern Italian life.

Visit the Vatican Museums and marvel at Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling. Stroll through Piazza Navona and Trevi Fountain, and don't forget to toss a coin for good luck.

While you’ll need a warm coat, temperatures rarely drop below freezing. For a warmer experience without the large crowds and intense humidity, consider visiting in May or September, when average temperatures range from the mid-70s to low 80s, providing comfortable weather for sightseeing.
